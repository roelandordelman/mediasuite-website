Annotations
---

Annotations include "codes" (or tags), comments, links, and other metadata that you manually add to your bookmarked items.

The Media Suite supports scholars in bookmarking items or fragments (for creating a corpus), and in adding their own annotations. These annotations can be: 

- **"Classifications"**, which are short words, tags, or key terms (the so-called "codes" in qualitative analysis research). These codes can be added from external controlled vocabularies or thesauri provided by the Media Suite, or entered on the fly according to the user preferences. 
- **Comments**: these are natural language notes written by the scholar. They take the form of personal "memos" or "commentaries" intended to be shared or exported.
- **Links**: users can add links to their items or fragments. These links can be external (for further reference), or internal (to other items or fragments in the Media Suite).
- **Metadata cards**: a very powerful feature of the annotation functionality is the possibility to add custom metadata templates (the properties are decided by the user), and values to those templates. These metadata can be used to describe the items or fragments more in detail, for further processing via the exporting facilities.

In Version 3 we support manual annotation only. Future versions will support automatic annotation (mainly for "classification" tasks), and will bring significant improvements in vocabulary and linking services.
